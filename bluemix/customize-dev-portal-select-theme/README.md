3. Under the Content heading, you can change the Content text and image for the Welcome banner by either entering text into the content editor, or selecting the Edit HTML Source icon to edit or paste HTML directly that defines image and text specifications.

4. Let's also add an image to our home screen. Scroll down to the Image heading. Find an image to use for your background and save it in the appropriate file format (png, gif, jpg, jpeg). If you don't have an image, you can use [this one](Cloudy_Day.png). Click **Choose File** and browse for your chosen background image. After you have selected the image, click **Upload**.

### Customize the theme for your developer portal
The developer portal allows you to modify the theme to change its look and feel.

1. To modify the theme, select **Appearance** from the top menu, then select **Settings** and then **IBM API Connect Theme**. This is the default theme when you created your developer portal.

2. The **Standard Layout** tab allows you to modify the layouts for devices with large screens, such as desktops. The **Tablet Layout** tab allows you to modify the layouts used on tablet devices. The **Smalltouch Layout** tab allows you to modify the layouts used on devices such as smartphones. After inspecting these tabs, select **Panels & Gpanels**.

3. In addition to modifying the Sidebar layouts above, the default theme supports the use of Gpanels, or Responsive Panels, if you install the Panels module. To control the panels layout on standard, tablet, and smalltouch devices, expand the sections and update the settings.

### Install a new theme for your developer portal
If modifying an existing theme doesn't suit your needs, the Developer portal also allows you to install a theme to change its look and feel.

1. You can use modules or themes downloaded from [drupal.org](http://drupal.org) to customize your developer portal or you can create your own.

2. To install a theme into the developer portal, select **Appearance** from the top menu, then select **Install new theme**.

3. You can install themes directly from [drupal.org](http://drupal.org) using a URL, or you can upload a theme you downloaded or created by clicking **Choose File**, then **Install**.  
  ![Install](images/6.3-install.png) 

4. When the upload completes, you need to enable the theme. Select **Enable newly added themes**.
