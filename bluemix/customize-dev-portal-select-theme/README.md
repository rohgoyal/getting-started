### Customize the theme for your developer portal
The Developer portal allows you to modify the theme it uses to change its look and feel.

2. The *Standard Layout* tab allows you to modify the layouts for devices with large screen such as desktops.  The *Tablet Layout* tab allows you to modify the layouts used on tablet devices.  The *Smalltouch Layout* allows you to modify the layouts used on devices such as smartphones.  After inspecting these tabs select **Panels & Gpanels**
